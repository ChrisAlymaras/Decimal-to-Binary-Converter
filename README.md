# Decimal-to-Binary-Converter
This is an educational JavaScript project tool that converts decimal numbers to binary format instantly. The converter includes an educational feature: when the input is 5, it activates a step-by-step stack visualization that demonstrates how the binary value is computed using division and remainder logic.

Key Features:

Converts any positive integer to binary instantly.

Special case for input 5: shows stack-based calculation steps.

Clean UI with responsive feedback.
